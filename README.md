# Activity-6

This activity was pretty simple. I had to check for exception handling in my program and to update my code so that it only displays three decimal points. As shown in the file attached, I updated the display box that shows the converted temperature, it will only show up to three places after the decimal. Included in my screenshots is the code, the program running before clicking the button, and the program running after I clicked the button.
